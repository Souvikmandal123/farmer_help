This project is basically based on, how a cs students helps a farmer. Here a farmer can gets the solution of their problems and can grow agricultural
productions. My project is AI based image detection, where a fermer can upload a picture of the effected leaf or plant and the solution will be
automatically generated based on their uploaded images.
